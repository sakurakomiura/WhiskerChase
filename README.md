# Whisker Chase 🐱🐭

This is my final project for [Code in Place 2025](https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/)!  
It's a fast-paced cat-and-mouse game made with Python and Pygame.

## 🎮 How to Play
- Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys to move the **cat**.
- Try to **catch the mouse** as fast as you can!
- Press `SPACE` to start the game, and press it again to retry after catching the mouse.

## 📦 Files
- `cat_game_pygame.py`: main game script
- `cat.png`: image of the cat
- `mouse.png`: image of the mouse
- `background.png`: game background

## 💻 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `pygame` library  
Make sure you have Python and pygame installed, then run:

```bash
pip install pygame
python cat_game_pygame.py
